===

[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is an awesome fuzzy-finder tool which
allows you to search through anything you give it.  You'll never need to call
it directly; it's automatically used in various places in this setup.  It
appears as a shiny-looking pane at the bottom with a place to type search
terms.  You'll probably know it when you see it.  It narrows down the results
based on what you type.  A couple commands to use from these contexts:
- `<ctrl-k>` moves selection up
- `<ctrl-j>` moves selection down
- `<enter>` chooses current selection
- `<ctrl-c>`, `<ctrl-[>`, or `<esc>` cancels the command
- Some contexts have other shortcuts you can use.  These will be documented
  when they occur.
