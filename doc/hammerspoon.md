Hammerspoon
===========

[Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) is an application for MacOS that
lets you customize basically anything about your computer using Lua.  I use it
for a few things:
- To remap the keyboard to handle simultaneous keypresses.  You'll see the
  shortcuts described in various places, but this is the tool that makes it
  possible.
- Get around pasteblockers.  Eg when you're trying to paste your password in
  somewhere and it won't let you, you can just press `<cmd><opt>V`.
- Automatically turn off the volume when you're at a cafe, and turn it back on
  when you're home.
- Caffeine: a little cup icon at the top of the screen that you can press to
  keep your computer from going to sleep.  Useful when you're training a neural
  net for a while.
